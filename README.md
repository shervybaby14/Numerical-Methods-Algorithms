# Numerical-Methods-Algorithms

This repository contains all of the algorithms that I created during my introduction to numerical methods course in the Spring Semester of 2018 at Colorado State University. The algorithms included are matlab scripts to perform the false position method, the LU Factorization of a matrix, and the Simpson's 1/3 composite rule for estimating an integral. 
## Intended Use
These algorithms can be used to perform different numerical methods such as estimating a root, decomposing a matrix, and estimating an integral.

## For Use
1. Copy Matlab script to your local path
2. Insert appropriate inputs as required.
