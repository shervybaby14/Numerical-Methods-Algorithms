# simpson.m
## Purpose
The Simpson function file was created to calculate the integral of area
given a set of X values, IN INCREASING ORDER, and Y values using the Simpson's 1/3 rule on the
intervals, except if the number of intervals is odd where the the single
application trapezoid rule is used on the last interval. 
## Inputs
* X: A series of X values(independent)
* Y: A series of Y Values(dependent)
## Outputs
The estimated area (I)
## Limitations
X values must be given in increasing order
